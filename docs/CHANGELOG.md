## [Unreleased] — 2026-05-29 — claudebase standardize

First standardized release. Repo renamed `claude-settings` → `claudebase` and reorganized by purpose for public-facing reuse.

### Added
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — directory model, symlink mechanism, plugin sync, secrets, drift detection
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md` — this file
- `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` — fork-friendly PR guide
- `LICENSE` — MIT
- Source-by-purpose top-level layout: `config/`, `runtime/`, `installer/`, alongside existing `docs/`, `platform/`, `shell/`, `secrets/`, `templates/`

### Removed
- `agents/paper-*.md` (6 agents) — replaced by `oh-my-scholar` plugin
- `skills/paper-write/` — replaced by `oh-my-scholar` plugin
- `skills/using-omc/` + its hooks fragment — role absorbed by omha's ROUTE injector hook
- `docs/ppt-skills.md` — `ppt-*` skills migrated to `oh-my-docs` plugin (earlier commit `e43e8b3`)
- Committed `.bak` files — `.gitignore` already covers them
- `install.sh` / `install.ps1` backup logic — symlink overwrite is safe, redundant under idempotency contract

### Changed
- Repository renamed: `claude-settings` → `claudebase` (GitHub auto-redirects old URL)
- Directory restructure (all `git mv`, history preserved):
  - `claude/{settings.json,CLAUDE.md,mcp.template.json}` → `config/`
  - `claude/hooks/` → `runtime/hooks/`
  - `claude/scripts/` → `installer/scripts/`
  - `agents/`, `skills/` → `runtime/`
  - `install.sh`, `install.ps1` → `installer/`
  - `specs/` merged into `docs/specs/`
- Installer entrypoint: `./install.sh` → `./installer/install.sh`
- `REPO_DIR` resolution in `installer/install.{sh,ps1}` now walks one directory up to handle the new layout
- README slimmed to a quick-start (details moved to `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`)

### Migration

Existing users on a machine that already has `~/claude-settings`:

```bash
cd ~/claude-settings
git pull
installer/install.sh    # picks up new layout, re-links symlinks if needed
installer/install.sh    # second run should be 0 actions
```

GitHub auto-redirects the old `claude-settings` URL, so no `git remote set-url` is strictly required, but recommended for clarity:

```bash
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/luckkim123/claudebase.git
```

Optional: rename the local clone too:

```bash
mv ~/claude-settings ~/claudebase
cd ~/claudebase
installer/install.sh    # re-points symlinks to the new path
```

New install: see `README.md`.

### Pre-claudebase tag

The state immediately before this standardize cycle is tagged `pre-claudebase-standardize-2026-05-29` for rollback.
